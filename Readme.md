Chiari Alliance

Mission Statement

Chiari malformation is a problem in which a part of the brain (the cerebellum) at the back of the skull bulges through a normal opening in the skull where it joins the spinal canal. This puts pressure on parts of the brain and spinal cord, and can cause mild to severe symptoms. The prevalence in the general population has been estimated at slightly less than one in one thousand people. The majority of these cases however are asymptomatic. Chiari is often detected by accident among patients who have undergone diagnostic imaging for unrelated reasons.

Because of the rarity of the disorder, but the severity and importance, Chiari Alliance will be a website created for people with Chiari Malformation to not only find resources for help, but also to track symptoms, mood, sleep, etc. and important information that could help track patterns and help keep track of information useful for medical records, medication, medical history, previous surgeries and hospitalizations, etc. I want to make it a journal useful for people with Chiari, but also list some resources for those newly diagnosed.

The reasoning behind my choice is someone with a chronic illness can get quickly flustered with loads of information. Especially when dealing with a new diagnosis. Itâ€™s important to be able to track all of your information somewhere safe and be able to pull it up when needed. I have a note in my phone that I try to keep up to date with Doctors and their phone number, current medications, medical history, etc. I want this website to be more specific and possible for someone to access. It can be nearly impossible to recall it all from memory.  The tracking mood, sleep, food, etc. can be important in noticing patterns and relaying those back to a doctor. The resources can be useful in finding extra support or information on Chiari.
